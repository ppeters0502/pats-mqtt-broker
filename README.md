# Pats MQTT Broker
### brought to you by Pat

## Summary and stuff
This is a project to try and get me to sharpen up on my C Programming Skills, learn a little bit about networking, and hopefully have a working project in the end that I can deploy to other devices if need be.

* I found the inspiration for this project from a post I found on [building your own MQTT broker from scratch](https://codepr.github.io/posts/sol-mqtt-broker)

* This project is heavily inspired from that project, and also from the [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) project, another MQTT broker that was implemented in C.
